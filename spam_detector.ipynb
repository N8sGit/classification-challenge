My rationale as for why RFC will perform better is that, generally speaking, it is a generally more robust algorithim, albeit more computationally intensive. Logistic Regression models are arguably more interperable, because they can be easily graphed, whereas RFC less so. Since we are unconcerned with computational cost and  visualizing the data in this case, RFC is probably the better option.  "
